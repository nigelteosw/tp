### Project: Well Informed Fridge Environment (WIFE)

Enhance life with WIFE! Our product Well Informed Fridge Environment <WIFE/> helps users to manage their food items 
in the fridge. With this, one never have to worry about optimizing storage and organization of food items in their 
refrigerator!

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list all the created tags.
  * What it does: Displays to the user the list of tags that had been created in WIFE.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can conveniently list
  all the tags that had been created in the system for easier reference. This allows the user to easily
  select the tags that user wish to tag their food item with.
  * Highlights: This feature is useful when the user wish to tag food or filter out food based on the tags
  available.

    the food item based on the food's unique characteristic. It also allows for easier search of the food item
    based on the tags allocated for the food item.
