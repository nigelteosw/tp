DEVELOPER GUIDE FOR WIFE
---
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction
WIFE is a food inventory management system that aims to aid busy users in managing food items in their fridge. With its 
inventory management system, users can easily edit their fridge's inventory and view it in a sleek and easy-to-read
list. Users can also tag their food items according to their preferences. </br>

This developer guide aims to provide detailed documentation for WIFE's design and implementation. This includes its 
architecture, design choices as well outlines for all features of the software. This project is released under the MIT
license, making it open source and available for anyone to use and modify.

## **Design**

Below is a high-level view of how WIFE is structured, including its key components.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
*(Diagram to be updated)*

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Food` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

![Structure of the UI Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `WifeParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a Food).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `WifeParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `WifeParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

*(Model Diagram to be updated)*


The `Model` component,

* stores WIFE data i.e., all `Food` and `Tag` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueFoodList` and `UniqueTagList` objects).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Food` and `Tag` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Food>` and `ObservableList<Tag>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `WIFE`, which `Food` references. This allows `Wife` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Food` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" /> 

*(Model Diagram to be updated)*

The `Storage` component,
* can save both WIFE data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `WifeStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.wife.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

#### General Implementation Details

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

Wife's `Food` object is composed of classes that represent the various attributes available in each `Food`. To ensure
efficient storage and organization, all items are stored in a UniqueFoodList, while their corresponding `Tag` are stored
in a separate UniqueTagList. `UniqueTagList` enforces a maximum limit on the number of tags that can be added to
Wife. By using these lists, Wife can easily manage and access its inventory, ensuring that it remains optimized
and easy to use.

The related attributes of a `Food` are:
- `Name`: Name of the Food
- `Unit`: Unit of measurement of the Food
- `Quantity`: Quantity of the Food
- `ExpiryDate`: Expiry Date of the Food

#### General Consideration Design

The design of `Food` class follows closely to the original `Person` class in AB3, with some modifications made to fit
the usage of WIFE.

- `Person` class was renamed to `Food` with its attribute modified to the attributes mentioned above.
- Addition of individual tags storage for each item to store their associated `Tag`.

### Item-related Features

#### Adding a Food

The `add` command adds a new `Food` in WIFE.

**Implementation**

The first stage of the implementation is parsing the user input to `AddCommand`. `AddCommandParser` is used
to parse and check whether the user input for each attribute `Food` is valid. After which an `AddCommand` object is 
created with the new `Food` object.
The second stage requires AddCommand#execute() to be called.

**Usage Scenario**

1. The user specifies a set of attributes for the new `Food` when adding a new `Food`.
2. If any of the attributes is empty, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in the command 
   with all necessary attributes being inserted.
3. If any of the inserted attributes is invalid, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in the 
   command with valid attributes.
4. If the `Food` inserted by the user has the same name and expiry date as another `Food` in the `Model`, an error is 
   returned to inform the user that there is a duplicated copy of `Food` in the `UniqueFoodList`.
5. Completion of step 4 without any exceptions will result in successful addition of a new `Food` in WIFE and stored in
   `UniqueFoodList`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add` command.

*(Sequence diagram to be inserted)*

#### Editing a Food

The `edit` command edits the attribute of selected `Food` in WIFE. The selected `Food` is specified
by retrieving from the one-indexed food list.

**Implementation**

The first stage of the implementation is parsing the user input to `EditCommand`. `EditCommandParser` is used
to parse and check whether the user input for the new attribute of `Food` is valid. After which an `EditCommand` object is
created with new `Food` with updated attributes.
The second stage requires EditCommand#execute() to be called.

**Usage Scenario**

1. The user specifies the food index that represents the `Food` to be edited.
2. If the index provided is a negative or zero index, an error response is returned and users will be 
   prompted to enter a valid index.
3. The user specifies the new attribute(s) for the `Food` when editing the `Food`. There must be at least one attribute
   provided when editing `Food`.
4. If any of the attributes is empty, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in the command
   with all necessary attributes being inserted.
5. If any of the inserted attributes is invalid, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in the
   command with valid attributes.
6. If the `Food` inserted by the user has the same name and expiry date as another `Food` in the `Model`, an error is
   returned to inform the user that there is a duplicated copy of `Food` in the `UniqueFoodList`.
7. Completion of step 6 without any exceptions will result in successful addition of a new `Food` in WIFE and stored in
   `UniqueFoodList`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add` command.

*(Sequence diagram to be inserted)*

#### Increase/Decrease quantity of a food item.

**Overview**

The increase/decrease quantity feature is meant to be a shorthand for users to change the quantity of a particular food item.
Traditionally, to change the quantity of an item, the user would use the edit command to edit the quantity of a food item.
The user can now specify `inc` or `dec` to increase or decrease the quantity of the indexed food item respectively.

**Design considerations**

* **Alternative 1:** The command parameter will be the new quantity of the food item to edit
    * Pros:
        * Easily implemented. The command parameter will be set as the new quantity of the item.
    * Cons:
        * May not be intuitive for the user, as the command is to increase/decrease the quantity.
        * Can be unnecessarily complicated for the user, i.e entering a higher quantity than the current quantity for
          `inc` and vice versa.
        * Does not significantly value-add to the product as compared to just using the edit command.

* **Alternative 2 (Current implementation):** The command parameter will be the quantity to increase/decrease the
  quantity of the food item by.
    * Pros:
        * Intuitive for the user to key in the quantity they want to increase/decrease by.
    * Cons:
        * Parameter to increase/decrease quantity must be checked that it is a positive integer.
        * Users will have to use separate commands to increase and decrease quantity.

Another aspect that was considered when implementing this feature was having a default quantity to increase and decrease
if no quantity was specified. We realised it was intuitive for users to make the default increment or decrement set to
1, easing convenience for the user.

**Implementation**
<div> Note: The implementation for `inc` and `dec` are the same, except the variable names and logic used to calculate 
new quantity (Addition/Subtraction) The described implementation is for the `inc` command. </div>

![IncreaseQuantitySequenceDiagram](images/IncreaseQuantitySequenceDiagram.png)

The first stage of the implementation is parsing the user input to `IncreaseCommand`. `IncreaseCommandParser` is used
to parse and check whether the user input is valid. After which a `IncreaseCommand` object is created along with a
`IncreaseFoodDescriptor` instance to increase the quantity of the current food item.

The second stage requires IncreaseCommand#execute() to be called.

**Usage Scenario**

1. The user specifies an index of the food item to be edited.
2. If the index is out of bounds from the food list, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in
   the command with the valid index.
3. If no specific quantity is specified, the quantity of the indexed food item will be increased by one.
4. If a specific quantity is specified, the quantity of the indexed food item will be increased by that value.
5. If the specific quantity is lesser than or equal to 0, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to
   key in the command with a valid quantity.


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `inc` command:

![IncreaseQuantityActivityDiagram](images/IncreaseQuantityActivityDiagram.png)

#### \[Implementing\] View details of a food item.

**Overview**
The view feature is meant to be a shorthand for users to view the details of a particular food item.
Traditionally, to view the details of an item, the user would use the list command to view the details of a food item.
The user can now specify `view` to view more details of the indexed food item.

The following UML diagram shows `view` and its associated class.

*(UML diagram to be inserted)*

**Design considerations**

* **Alternative 1 (Current implementation):** The command view with the index of the food item to view the details of.
    * Pros:
        * Intuitive for the user to key in the quantity they want to increase/decrease by.
    * Cons:
        * Parameter to increase/decrease quantity must be checked that it is a positive integer.
        * Feels like a hacky solution to the problem.
        * Does not significantly value-add to the product as compared to just using the edit command.

* **Alternative 2 :** Have a ui switcher to switch between the different views i.e. list view and details view.
  * Pros:
    * Code should be easier to maintain, or add new views in the future.
  * Cons:
    * Difficulty in implementing the switcher.
    * Difficulty in implementing the different views.

**Implementation**
The first stage of the implementation is checking that the command is `view` and that the index is valid. `ViewCommandParser` is used
to parse and check whether the user input is valid. After which a `ViewCommand` object is created which will be used to switch the
view from the list view to the details view.

**Usage Scenario**

1. The user specifies an index of the food item to be viewed.
2. If the index is out of bounds from the food list, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in
   the command with the valid index.
3. If no specific quantity is specified, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in
   the command with the valid index.
4. If a specific quantity is specified, the item will be displayed in the view.
5. If the specific quantity is lesser than or equal to 0, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to
   key in the command with a valid index.

The following activity diagram shows the usage of the `view` command.

#### List Food by tag.

**Overview**
The List by tag feature is meant to be a list all the food by the specified tags.

The following UML diagram shows `Tag` and its associated class.

*(UML diagram to be inserted)*

**Design considerations**

* **Alternative 1:** The command parameter will be the tag name of the food to display
    * Pros:
        * Easily implemented. The command parameter will show the food with the specified tag name
    * Cons:
        * May not be convenient for the user, as the command allows only 1 tag name at a time.

* **Alternative 2 (Current implementation):** The command parameter will be the tag name of the food to display.
    * Pros:
        * Convenient for the user to key in multiple tag names to display.
    * Cons:
        * Parameter for multiple tag names must be checked that it is not empty
        * Users will have to use separate commands by `n/` which maybe a hassle

**Implementation**
The first stage of the implementation is parsing the user input to `ListByTagCommand`. `ListByTagCommandParser` is used
to parse and check whether the user input is valid. After which a `ListByTagCommand` object is created with the specified
tag name.

The second stage requires ListByTagCommand#execute() to be called.

**Usage Scenario**

1. The user specifies tags of the food item to be displayed.
2. If no tag is specified, an error response is returned to prompt user to follow the command format.
3. If the tag does not exist in `UniqueTagList`, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in the command with the valid tag name.
4. If a valid tag is specified, the indexed food item with the specified tags will be displayed.

The following activity diagram shows the usage of the `listbytag` command.

#### Delete Food by tag.

**Overview**
The delete by tag feature is meant to be delete all the food by the specified tags.

The following UML diagram shows `Tag` and its associated class.

*(UML diagram to be inserted)*

**Design considerations**

* **Alternative 1:** The command parameter will be the tag name of the food to delete
    * Pros:
        * Easily implemented. The command parameter will delete the food with the specified tag name
    * Cons:
        * May not be convenient for the user, as the command allows only 1 tag name at a time.

* **Alternative 2 (Current implementation):** The command parameter will be the tag name of the food to delete.
    * Pros:
        * Convenient for the user to key in multiple tag names to display.
    * Cons:
        * Parameter for multiple tag names must be checked that it is not empty
        * Users will have to use separate commands by `n/` which maybe a hassle

**Implementation**
The first stage of the implementation is parsing the user input to `DeleteByTagCommand`. `DeleteByTagCommandParser` is used
to parse and check whether the user input is valid. After which a `DeleteByTagCommand` object is created with the specified tag name.

The second stage requires DeleteByTagCommand#execute() to be called.

**Usage Scenario**

1. The user specifies tags of the food item to be delete.
2. If no tag is specified, an error response is returned to prompt user to follow the command format.
3. If the tag does not exist in `UniqueTagList`, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in the command with the valid tag name.
4. If a valid tag is specified, the food item with the specified tags will be deleted.

The following activity diagram shows the usage of the `delbytag` command.

*(Activity diagram to be inserted)*

### Tag-related Features

#### Overview

The tagging functionality is facilitated by the `UniqueTagList` stored in `WIFE`. Creating and deleting tags will
modify the tags within the `UniqueTagList` which contains all existing `Tag` objects. Additionally, every food item
within WIFE has its own collection of associated `Tag` objects stored in an internal Set<Tag>. Tagging/untagging a `Tag` to a `Food` will
add/remove the corresponding `Tag` object to/from the `Set<Tag>` stored within `Food` This allows for efficient tagging 
and organization of items across multiple lists.

The following UML diagram shows `Tag` and its associated class.

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="574" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to store the tags for WIFE and each food item. **

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store `Tag` in `UniqueTagList` and each `Food` stores its own set of associated
    `Tag` objects.
    * Pros: 
      * Easy to implement.
      * Users are able to create and reuse the same `Tag` that may be extensible for editing to suit their own use
        case instead of providing a preset list of tags that cannot be extended for other food items in the list.
    * Cons: 
      * May have performance issues in terms of memory usage as additional storage is used.

* **Alternative 2:** Instantiates `Tag` with a specified name and stores all food classified by the tag in the 
    instantiated class.
    * Pros:
        * Saves space. There is no need to store the set of associated `Tag`, `Set<Tag>` in `Food`. The association
          of `Food` to `Tag` is represented by `List<Food>` in `Tag` object.
        * Easily extensible. Creating a new `Tag` can be done by simply instantiating a new `Tag` object.
    * Cons:
        * May be more complicated in terms of implementation as compared to alternative 1.
        * Approach is not as intuitive as compared to alternative 1 (simpler to add each `Tag` to the `Food`)
      
_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

#### Creating a new Tag

**Overview**

User can create a new pre-defined `Tag` in WIFE with the `createtag` command. The `createtag` command creates a new tag 
in WIFE which can be used to create a new tag that can be used to classify food items in food lists. Once the tag is 
created using this command, the tag can be applied to food items using the `tag` command.

**Implementation**

The first stage of the implementation is parsing the user input to `CreateTagCommand`. `CreateTagCommandParser` is used 
to parse and check whether the user input is valid. After which a `CreateTagCommand` object is created with the specified
tag name. 
The second stage requires CreateTagCommand#execute() to be called.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `createtag` command.

<img src="images/CreateTagSequenceDiagram.png" width="700" />

**Usage Scenario**

1. The user specifies a tag name for the new tag when creating a new tag.
2. If the tag name is empty, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in the command with the valid
   tag name.
3. If the tag name is invalid, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in the command with a valid
   tag name.
4. If the tag name inserted by the user has the same tag name as another tag in the `Model`, an error is returned to
   inform the user that there is already a duplicated copy of tag in the `UniqueTagList`.
5. If the tag storage of WIFE is full, an error response is returned to inform that the user has reached the maximum
   capacity of the tag storage and will not be able to insert additional tag.
6. Completion of step 5 without any exceptions will result in successful creation of a new `Tag` in WIFE and stored in
   `UniqueTagList`

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `createtag` command:

<img src="images/CreateTagActivityDiagram.png" width="700" />


#### Deleting a Tag

The `deltag` command deletes existing tag(s) in WIFE. This means food that are initially tagged with the specified tag(s) will have that tag removed.

**Implementation**

The first stage of the implementation is parsing the user input to `DeleteTagCommand`. `DeleteTagCommandParser` is used to parse and check whether the user input is valid. After which a `DeleteTagCommand` object is created with the specified tag name. The second stage requires DeleteTagCommand#execute() to be called.

**Usage Scenario**

1. The user specifies tag name(s) for the tag(s) to be deleted.
2. If the tag name is empty, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in the command with the valid tag name.
3. If all tag name(s) are invalid, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in the command with a valid tag name.
4. If some tag name(s) are invalid, invalid tag names will be ignored and valid tag names will be processed.
5. Completion of step 4 without any exceptions will result in successful deletion of specified `Tag` in WIFE and `Food` with specified tag(s) will have that tag(s) removed

The following sequence diagram shows how the `deltag` command.

*(Sequence diagram to be inserted)*

#### Tagging a Food

User may choose to tag a `Food` in `WIFE` with any of the pre-defined `Tag` created. This can simply
be done using the command `tag`. This tagging function allows user to easily classify their `Food` in
the fridge.

**Implementation**

The first stage of the implementation is parsing the user input to `TagFoodCommand`. `TagFoodCommandParser` is used
to parse and check whether the user input is valid. After which a `TagFoodCommand` object is created with the specified
index and tag name.
The second stage requires TagFoodCommand#execute() to be called.

**Usage Scenario**

1. The user specifies the index of the food to be tagged and the name of the tag.
2. If the index is out of bounds from the food list, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in
   the command with the valid index.
3. If no specific tag name is specified, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in
   the command with a tag name.
4. If the tag name specified does not exist in WIFE, an error response is returned and users will need to create the tag
   before having access to the tag.
5. Completion of step 4 without any exception will result in successful tagging of the food with the
   specified tag.

#### Untagging a Food

The `untag` feature removes a specified tag from a food item.

**Implementation**

The first stage of the implementation is parsing the user input to `UntagCommand`. `UntagCommandParser` is used to parse and check whether the user input is valid - if the tag exists or does not exist in the food item's internal tag set. After which, an `UntagCommand` object is created with the specified tag name to be removed. The second stage requires UntagCommand#execute() to be called which then removes the tag from the food item.

**Usage Scenario**

1. The user specifies tag name to be removed for a food item index.
2. If the food item does not have that tag, an error response is returned and users will be prompted to key in the command with a valid tag name.
3. Completion of step 1 without any exceptions will result in successful removal of the specified `Tag` from the `Food` item.

The sequence diagram of `untag` is similar to that of the `tag` command.

### Dynamic Help

![HelpCommandActivityDiagram.png](images%2FHelpCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The dynamic help mechanism allows the user to receive in-app help for the specific command being queried i.e. `help add`. It extends the traditional help functionality where the user only received general help. The help commands and respective outputs are stored internally as enums in `HelpMenu.java`. Additionally, `HelpMenu.java` implements the following operations:

HelpMenu#getGeneralHelp()â€‰â€”â€‰Retrieves a general help message if the user inputs `help`.
HelpMenu#getCommandHelp()â€‰â€”â€‰Retrieves the command specific help message.
HelpMenu#parseCommand()â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the command input in `help COMMAND` to ensure it is a valid command.

These operations are invoked in `HelpCommandParser.java` which calls HelpMenu#getGeneralHelp() or HelpMenu#getCommandHelp() depending on the help command input after parsing the input with HelpMenu#parseCommand().

#### Feature Details:

Step 1. After successful retrieval of the help message, the message is passed to the `HelpCommand` object returned by `HelpCommandParser`.

Step 2. The `LogicManager` executes the `HelpCommand` object which generates a `Command Result` object with the help message.

Step 3. MainWindow#executeCommand() extracts the help message from the `CommandResult` and sends it to `HelpWindow` as the text to be set in the FXML `label`.
